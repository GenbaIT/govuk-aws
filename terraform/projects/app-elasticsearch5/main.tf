/**
* ## Project: app-elasticsearch5
*
* Managed Elasticsearch 5 cluster
*
* This project has two gotchas, where we work around things terraform
* doesn't support:
*
* - Deploying the cluster across 3 availability zones: terraform has
*   some built-in validation which rejects using 3 master nodes and 3
*   data nodes across 3 availability zones.  To provision a new
*   cluster, only use two of everything, then bump the numbers in the
*   AWS console and in the terraform variables - it won't complain
*   when you next plan.
*
*   https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/7504
*
* - Configuring a snapshot repository: terraform doesn't support this,
*   and as far as I can tell doesn't have any plans to.  There's a
*   Python script in this directory which sets those up.
