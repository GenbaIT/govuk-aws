## Modules: aws/lb

This module creates a Load Balancer resource, with associated
listeners and default target groups, and CloudWatch alarms

The listeners and default actions are configured in the `listener_action`
map. The keys are the listeners PROTOCOL:PORT parameters, and the values
are the PROTOCOL:PORT parameters of the default target group of that listener.

```
listener_action = {
  "HTTP:80"   = "HTTP:8080"
  "HTTPS:443" = "HTTP:8080"
}
```

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
AWS/ApplicationELB namespace:

  - HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold

All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
during 5 consecutive periods.

To disable any alarm, set the threshold parameter to 0.
